## Summary

The macro document of the FY25-26 Union Budget.

some interesting points

- interest payments are now 20% of total expenditure. the guidance for lower fiscal deficits for FY26 is going to be harder assuming real rates stay high
- india's deficit financing is very interesting in that T-bills make up for almost NOTHING and Bonds make up all of the financing. this is mostly because they use the borrowings for capital asset creation and for LT stability 
- this is confirmed by the capex/gdp number (4.3%). very healthy use of financing, i am impressed by bjp
