## Summary

Michael Pettis again. the previous piece had a point that notes reducing the fiscal deficit could cause issues in other parts of the economy. this paper talks about the various assumptions in trade and BoP models. the main focus of this piece is on the effect that reducing the fiscal deficit could have on the trade deficit and capital account surpluses of the U.S. He argues that capital account adjusts independently by foreign and U.S. investors (tagged 'push argument' from the above piece)
