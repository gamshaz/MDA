## Summary

- services inflation is slowing. @ 3.4% YoY now. 
	- this is less than in UK & EU
- non durable goods inflation might be ticking but nothing to worry about imo (tariff worries?)
- DPI @ 1.8% YoY
	- drastically slowed from 2.2% YoY previous month (due to a fall in personal spending MoM)
- savings rate increased to 4.6% from 3.9% Dec 2024 !!!!!
	- is consumer health (growth) not the same anymore?!??
