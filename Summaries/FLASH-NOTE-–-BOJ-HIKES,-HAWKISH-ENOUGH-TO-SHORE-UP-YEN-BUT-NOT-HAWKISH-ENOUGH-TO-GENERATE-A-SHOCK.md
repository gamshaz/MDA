## Summary

Evercore's commentary on the last BoJ chief Ueda speech. Ueda not sure about the R* for Japan but gave a range of 1%-2.5%. markets price in 0.75% and Ueda did not disagree nor did he agree, tone consistent with the outlook report (see above). Evercore thinks the default hike pace is once/6months although it could increase to once/quarter if the conditions ask to do so
