## Summary

Pre-Union Budget Economic Survey of India 2024-25. obviously an extremely important document to understand Indian macro developments.
so this original document is ~500 pages long. but BS published their piece on Saturday that condensed the content within 50-100 pages, which made it much more readable. i have tried to condense it even further into the most important bullet points below:

- deregulation is the big talk of the town now, deregulation will boost productivity in labour and capital

- bring the share of investments to 35% of GDP as compared to 31% now

- a big push towards manufacturing to create jobs and boost GDP

- MSMEs to be the main driver of growth, via profits and the help of deregulation

- massive skill gap still persists in the market. only about 7.6% of the workforce have a graduate degree and about 2.2% have a PG. around 70% of the wf only has secondary education. also spoke about AI being a tailwind but could disrupt the labour market very greatly (negative way)

- wage growth hasn't followed the trend of profit growth in companies, especially IT and svcs companies

- push to train the wf to get into the skilled force, both in mfg (through training institutes) and services as well to boost the revs from svcs sector

- external debt situation is very well managed. standing at about 18.7% of GDP now w/ an absolute amount of ~$650B

- talk on svcs exports as % of scvs GVA increasing (not that impressive according to me, still a lottt of room to improve)

- big push towards entrepreneurship

- India needs to boost its exports with a focus on quality (they mention that horrible EU trade laws need to change, it is hurting EMs at the benefit of those fools)

- the need to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals and supply chains

- the importance of reducing tariffs in global trade

- lots of agri talk - importance of the sector and the ability of agri to absorb surplus labour if growth is boosted

- 'wholehearted acceptance' of PPPs in infra projects. pvt participation in infra capex is below the expectations of finance ministry. leading sectors in PPP capex = ports & shipping, civil aviation, railways

- balance fossil fuels with clean energy. no real alternative to burning coal in the short-medium term but investments in green must continue to reduce China dependence

- public transportation a more viable alternative to pvt EVs

- it is time to tackle misleading nutrition claims and information on ultra-processed foods
